  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Assigning Pok&eacute;mon to Tiles</h2>

  <p>Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
  (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
  classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
  raise your hand to let them know.</p>

  <h3>What's Next?</h3>

  <p>
    The next thing we need to do is to figure out which Pok&eacute;mon will be
    placed on which tiles. To do this, we will write code into the
    <code>assignPokemonToTiles</code> function in our JavaScript file. But
    before we do that, we need to talk about our strategy for storing the
    Pok&eacute;mon information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our tiles are laid out in a two-dimensional fashion (four rows by four
    columns). However, in order to make things easier for us, our Pok&eacute;mon
    information will be stored in a one-dimensional list. This basically means
    we will have 16 Pok&eacute;mon names in one array, and every title will have
    to know which index to use to match up with its Pok&eacute;mon information.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we will add index information to our tiles in the
    <code>renderTiles</code> function, so that we can use it later on. Then we
    will create our list of Pok&eacute;mon.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>

  <p>
    Inside <code>renderTiles</code>, we need to make two changes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Add an <code>index</code> variable at the beginning of the function</li>
    <li>Set the index on each tile as we create it, and increment the index</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    First, let's create our <code>index</code> variable. We will use a
    <code>let</code> declaration because we will be changing the value as we
    create our tiles. This declaration should go before anything else in the
    <code>renderTiles</code> function.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we have created our <code>index</code> variable, we will use it
    and increment it as we create tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside your <i>inner for loop</i>, after we create the <code>$tile</code>
    but before we append it to <code>$tileRow</code>, we need to set our index
    on the tile.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can do this using the <code>.data()</code> function provided by jQuery.
    The <code>.data()</code> function takes two arguments. First is the name of
    our data point (which can be any string), and second is the value.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add these lines between when we create the <code>$tile</code> variable and
    when we append it to <code>$tileRow</code>:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
    $tile.data("tileIndex", index);
    index += 1;
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Make sure to save all files and refresh your preview to make sure we haven't
    broken anything.
