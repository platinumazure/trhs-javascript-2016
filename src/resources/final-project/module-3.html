  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Creating Tiles</h2>

  <p>Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
  (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
  classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
  raise your hand to let them know.</p>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>

  <p>Remove the <code>.append()</code> call we did in the last module. If you
  refresh the page in your browser, your message should no longer be showing.</p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>We are going to use a concept called nested for loops to create a 4 by 4
  grid of tiles for our memory game.  Inside of our jQuery function, after
  the call to <code>.empty()</code>, declare a <code>const</code> variable called
  <code>gridSize</code>. Set it equal to 4.</p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>Now, start a for-loop. Name the variable for the for-loop <code>column</code>
  and set it equal to 0. Have the for-loop run as long as the <code>column</code>
  variable is less than the <code>gridSize</code> variable. Increment the
  <code>column</code> variable by 1 using the <code>+=</code> operator. When you
  are finished, it should look like this:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">for (let column = 0; column < gridSize; column += 1) { }</code-block>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>Inside the braces of this for loop, create a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
  element using jQuery and store it in a variable.</p>
  
  <p>When using a variable to store a jQuery object, it is a good idea to prefix
  the variable with <code>$</code>. This will help you remember that the variable
  value is a jQuery object.</p>
  
  <p>When you have finished, your code should look like the code below:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">var $tileRow = $(&quot;&lt;div class=&#39;tile-row&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;);</code-block>
  
  <p>
    <b><i>Important:</i></b> At this point, your tile row has not been added to
    the page. The div inside <code>$tileRow</code> is said to be <i>detached</i>
    from the page. This is like when you write on a post-it note, but you haven't
    stuck the post-it note on the wall. Our tile row exists, it just hasn't been
    stuck on the "wall" (HTML page) yet.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>

  <p>Right after the <code>$tileRow</code> variable you just created, create
  another <code>for-loop</code>, which we will refer to as the <i>inner for-loop</i>.
  Name the for-loop variable <code>row</code>, set it to equal 0, and have the
  loop run as long as row is less than <code>gridSize</code>.  Increment
  <code>row </code> by 1 each iteration.</p>
  
  <p>See if you can figure out how to write this for loop on your own. If you get stuck,
  ask for help.</p>
  
  <p>
    The overall outer/inner loop structure should look like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
for (let column = 0; column < gridSize; column += 1) {
  const $tileRow = /* ... */

  for (let row /* that's all you get here :-), ask a classmate or Adam/Kevin if you need help */) {
  }
}
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>

  <p>Inside the braces for the inner for-loop, we will again create a new
  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element using the same syntax as in Step 4. Name
  your variable <code>$tile</code>. The reasoning behind this will become clear
  in the next module. The HTML code you should have is below:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">&lt;div class=&#39;tile&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code-block>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>

  <p>We now should append our "tile" variable to our "tilerow" div. We can use
  the <code>.append()</code> function for this. The contents of your inner
  for-loop should look like the code below:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
var $tile = $(&quot;&lt;div class=&#39;tile&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;);
$tileRow.append(tile);
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 8</h3>

  <p>Immediately after the inner for-loop, outside of the braces for it, append
  the contents of <code>$tileRow</code> to the tiles div. Again, you should use
  the <code>.append()</code> function here. You can pass <code>$tileRow</code>
  right into append, no HTML is needed here. Once you have done this, refresh
  your page.</p>
  
  <p>
    The append code should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
$(/* remember how to get the "tiles" element by its ID? */)
  .append($tileRow);
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    You should now see a 4 by 4 grid of tiles when you save your files and
    refresh the page.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Sanity Check</h3>
  
  <p>
    The overall structure of the JavaScript file should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
$(function () {
  const gridSize = 4;
  
  for (let column = 0; /* etc. for outer for loop */) {
    const $tileRow = $(/* create a div tag */);
    
    for (let row = 0; /* etc. for inner for loop */) {
      const $tile = $(/* create a div tag */);
      
      $tileRow.append($tile);
    }
    
    $(/* get "tiles" div by ID */).append($tileRow);
  }
});
  </code-block>

  <p>Once you have finished, please raise your hand so either Kevin or Adam can
  check your work.</p>
