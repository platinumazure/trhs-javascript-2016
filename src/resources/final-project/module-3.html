  <h1>Final Project</h1>
  <h2>Module 3</h2>

  <p>Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
  (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
  classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
  raise your hand to let them know.</p>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>

  <p>Remove the <code>.append()</code> call we did in the last module. If you
  refresh the page in your browser, your message should no longer be showing.</p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>We are going to use a concept called nested for loops to create an 4 by 4
  grid of tiles for our memory game.  Inside of our jQuery function, and after
  the call to <code>.empty()</code>, declare a variable called "gridsize".
  Set it equal to 4.</p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>Now, start a for-loop. Name the variable for the for-loop "column" and set
  it equal to 0. Have the for-loop run as long as the "column" variable is less
  than the "gridsize" variable. Increment the column variable by 1 using the ++
  operator. When you are finished, it should look like this:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">for (var column = 0; column < gridsize; column++) { }</code-block>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>Inside the braces of this for loop, create a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
  element using jQuery and store it in a variable. Your code should look like
  the code below:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">var tilerow = $(&quot;&lt;div class=&#39;tile-row&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;);</code-block>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>

  <p>Right after the "tilerow" variable you just created, create another
  <code>for-loop</code>, which we will refer to as the "inner for-loop".
  Name the variable "row", set it to equal 0, and have the loop run as long as
  row is less than "gridsize".  Increment "row" by 1 each iteration.  See if
  you can figure out how to write this for loop on your own. If you get stuck,
  ask for help.</p>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>

  <p>Inside the braces for the inner for-loop, we will again create a new
  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element using the same syntax as in Step 4. Name
  your variable &quot;tile&quot;. The reasoning behind this will become clear
  in the next module. The HTML code you should have is below:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">&lt;div class=&#39;tile&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code-block>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>

  <p>We now should append our "tile" variable to our "tilerow" div. We can use
  the <code>.append()</code> function for this. The contents of your inner
  for-loop should look like the code below:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">var tile = $(&quot;&lt;div class=&#39;tile&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;); tilerow.append(tile);</code-block>

  <h3>Step 8</h3>

  <p>Immediately after the inner for-loop, outside of the braces for it, append
  the contents of "tilerow" to tiles. Again, you should use the
  <code>.append()</code> function here. You can pass tilerow right into append,
  no HTML is needed here. Once you have done this, refresh your page. You should
  now see a 4 by 4 grid of tiles.</p>

  <p>Once you have finished, please raise your hand so either Kevin or Adam can
  check your work.</p>
